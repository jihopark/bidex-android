Bidex is an online auction platform that sells experiences to the market in a more transparent and sociable way. BidEx solves the problem of bidding overpriced experience and the process of making decisions alone by improving transparency of the bidding process. Bidders can bid for any experiences they wish to purchase and the experiences will be awarded to the person who bids the highest price within a limited time period. BidEx is provided as Web App and Android App. Its prototype is built with Angular.js, Java, Mysql, and Parse. The highest bidder will check out through MasterCard express, integrating with Simplify E-Commerce and MasterPass API.

Used Parse from Facebook to implement simple backend for demo
